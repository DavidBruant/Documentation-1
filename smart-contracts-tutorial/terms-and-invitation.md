# Terms and invitation

This tutorial builds on a [previous tutorial](./first-contract.md). You may want to get familiar with it before continuing reading this page

## Configuring the number of attempts

We want to configure the contract so that it can be set up for the player to have a limited number of attempts

That's when we would be using the `terms`:

Contract code (`guess.js`):
```js
// Our contract defines that `terms` must be an object with a `attemptsCount` property
function guessContract(terms, inviteMaker) {
  const seat = harden({
    guess(attempt) {
      return attempt === terms.attemptsCount ? 'you win' : 'you lose';
    },
  });

  return harden({
    playerInvite: inviteMaker.make('player', seat),
  });
}

export default guessContract.toString();
```

vat-demo.js code:
```js
import harden from '@agoric/harden';
import guessContractSource from '../../contracts/guess.js';

function build(E, log) {
  let sharedGame;

  async function startup(host) {
    const guessInstallation = await E(host).install({
      start: guessContractSource,
    });
    // aside from naming changes, only this line changed with terms argument to `.spawn`
    const { playerInvite } = await E(guessInstallation).spawn({toGuess: 94});
    sharedGame = await E(host).redeem(playerInvite);
  }

  async function createDemoClientBundle() {
    const chainBundle = {
      game: sharedGame,
    };
    return harden(chainBundle);
  }

  return harden({ startup, createDemoClientBundle });
}

export default function setup(syscall, state, helpers) {
  return helpers.makeLiveSlots(
    syscall,
    state,
    E => build(E, helpers.log),
    helpers.vatID,
  );
}
```

That's it! That was easy!

In more real life examples, the terms can be used to parametrize when the contract expires or a minimum amount (and which currency) to commit to the contract for participating, etc.


## Sending an invite for someone else to play

- Amethyst sets up the contract. It produces a `game` object and a `handoffService`
=> This is done via **Amethyst's solo node**
- Amethyst produces a `corkboard` using the `handoffService`
=> This creates a URL like `https://example/corkboard/ng2oeg938vEgpoj9U` (random at the end)
- Amethyst puts the `guess` function of the `game` as the `"guess"` key of the corkboard
=> The message can be retrieved via `https://example/corkboard/ng2oeg938vEgpoj9U/guess`
- Amethyst shares the url with Pearl
- Pearl opens the game (how?), then puts the url in a dedicated field
=> The url is sent to **Pearl's solo node**
=> **Pearl's solo node** retrieves the function and exposes it to UI
- Pearl plays the game
